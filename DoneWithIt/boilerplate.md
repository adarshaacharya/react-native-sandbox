 starc, cummins,  stoinis and warner are rested. Cameroon Green debut today,  Moises played ODI match after 5 years and Sean Abott after 5 years , Agar isn't even their got to bowler in ODI. Experimented marnus by playing him as opener which was the position he never played. still lost by bare margin of 15 runs. Clearly aus wanna test their bench strength.

 Aron Finch and Pat Cummins really change the fortune of Australia on White ball game. Before they don't use to give priority to the T20 format that much and slowly getting  weak at ODI games. They were morally and mentally down after incident on South Africa. Got whitewashed by Pak, SA, England , lost to India..  

But after 2019 India tour fortune really changed for them. Won 3-2 at India without key players,  whitewashed  India at t20 on their home ground.   Won against Pak at their home ground. Cummins doesn't get enough appreciation but he really rose up  in the occassion and become their key performer with ball and bat. Had an excellent worldcup campaign especially comeback of Warner, Smith and Stack was brilliant.  Won t20 series at SA , Won  ODI series at England where England got defeated on home ground after 5 years.  Now, won series against India.. Even though Starc, Cummins and Warner weren't playing they lose by 10-15 runs which is not bad tbh. Looking forward for t20 series pretty sure they will won it too.

What a comeback story it has been !
