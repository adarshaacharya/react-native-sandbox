# Capturing Taps

## Background

An app isn't much if a user can't interact with it. The most basic form of interaction is capturing a user's tap (or press) on a screen.

This is quite straight forward with built in components from React Native - most directly through the `Button` component.

With this component once you render it you'll then interact with it via props. Namely `title` and `onPress`.

## Exercise

Using the `Button` component, capture a tap event and `alert` "hello".

## Extra Credit

1. Rather than using the `Button` component, use the `TouchableOpacity` and `Text` components to create your own with the same functionality.
