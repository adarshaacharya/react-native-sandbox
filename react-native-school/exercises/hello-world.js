// Hello, World!

// When using JSX React needs to be in scope. This means you have to import it.
// import React from "react";

// Unlike working with HTML, the building blocks of our UI are not global. Therefore we need to
// import them.
// import { View, Text } from "react-native";

// TIP: A component is simply a function from which we return JSX.
// const App = () => {}

// TIP: Components can nest and have children. <View><Text></Text></View>

// TIP: Styling happens via the style prop. That style, in it's most basic form, is simply an
// object. style={{ ... }}

// We need to export App/Component so it's rendered on the screen. To work in this example app you
// need to use export default. Dont' worry about this right now, we'll talk about it later.
// export default App;

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        padding: '20px',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        width: 100,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <Text style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Hello world</Text>
    </View>
  );

export default App;
