# Scrollable Content

## Background

Rarely does all of the content you want to display completely fit into the user's screen - that's where scrolling comes in.

We've already built components that use the `View` component. This is a fixed sized component. Fortunately React Native also has a `ScrollView` component - I'll let you guess what this does.

Don't worry about efficiency with large lists right now - let's just get a basic scrollable list going.

## Exercise

Render 15 squares in a scrollable list.

**Note:** Depending on how you implement this solution you may run into a warning that "each child in a list should have a unique key..." You can safely ignore this warning for now. There's info in the "Helpful Links" section which goes into this more.
